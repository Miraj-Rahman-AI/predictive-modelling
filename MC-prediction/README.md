# MonteCarloPrediction
Displays and helps analyze the possible value of an asset using the [Monte Carlo Algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm)
This is in no way supposed to be a prediction tool as the daily 'predictions' are completely random.
It is built to help analyze the diffirent ways an asset can fluxuate in value.
Also note that the mean value of the endpoints will 'most likely' allways be the same as the starting price due to the nature of the Monte Carlo Algorithm, per step in time it either increases or decreases with the daily % change.

### How it works
I have a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYRHRY4tEx4&ab_channel=MathisVanEetvelde) explaining how it works. Unfortunately it is rather outdated but the concept stayed the same.
